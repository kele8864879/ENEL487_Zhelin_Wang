The assignment has three file, a main.cpp, an input.txt and an output.txt.  
The main function has three part, they are batch mode function( and batch mode calculation), interactive function, and 
class Complex which works for the calculation. I made the guide interface, so it should be easy to follow. I also post some 
running result at the folder.
The program can running the TXT file, but it has some bug that I do not know how to fix when running PYTHON file.
The old version ( like the version before 2012 year? ) v++ might cannot run the program, so please update the version
of g++.
