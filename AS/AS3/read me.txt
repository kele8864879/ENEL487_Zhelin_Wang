It is the read me for AS3
Design theory:  User enter a command string to console, then the code will seperate string to different
part by find the "space" between number and command in the string.  the catched value will be stored in a double array
n[3]. then according to n[3]'s value to run different algorithm get answer.

The code can do all of the required calculation, and it can recognize the mistake in division and inv function (divide by 0).
it can also recognize the wrong command. However, it can not deal with the wrong value, like A a 1 v c. 
The input format is like A 1 2 3 4. please do not enter two space between values, like A  1  2  3  4.
